# euler

Project Euler solutions written in Python.

## Setup

Make sure you have poetry and Python 3.10 installed. I recommend using something like pyenv to manage your Python versions.

1. Spawn a new shell with `poetry shell`
2. Install dependencies with `poetry install`

## Running a solution

Run a solution with `./solve --problem N`

If you want to run against the test case, add the `--test` flag, e.g. `./solve --problem 1 --test`
