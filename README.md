# euler

Project Euler solutions written in Python.

## Setup

Make sure you have poetry and Python 3.10 installed. I recommend using something like pyenv to manage your Python versions.

1. Spawn a new shell with `poetry shell`
2. Install dependencies with `poetry install`
3. Run the program with `python euler`
